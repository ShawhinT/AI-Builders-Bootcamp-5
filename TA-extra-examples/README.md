# TA Extra Examples

This directory contains additional examples that demonstrate production-level AI techniques beyond what's covered in the main course sessions.

## Example 1: Structuring LLM Responses

Demonstrates how to make LLM outputs more reliable and consistent for production systems using data validation and structured outputs.

Examples:
- [Main Notebook - Structured Responses](./example%201%20-%20structuring%20responses/example_1-structuring_responses.ipynb) - Comprehensive guide to structured LLM outputs
- [Web Scraping Example](./example%201%20-%20structuring%20responses/example_1.1-webscraping.py) - Using Pydantic and Crawl4AI for structured data extraction
- [Advanced Crawling](./example%201%20-%20structuring%20responses/example_1.2-crawling.py) - Advanced web crawling techniques with session reuse
- [Mirascope Integration](./example%201%20-%20structuring%20responses/example_1.3-mirascope.py) - Simplified structured output handling with Mirascope

## Example 2: Prompt Optimization with DSPy

Demonstrates systematic optimization of LLM prompts using DSPy, moving beyond manual prompt engineering to a programmatic approach based on metrics and examples.

Examples:
- [DSPy Notebook](./example%202%20-%20prompt%20optimization/example_2-DSPy.ipynb) - LinkedIn ghostwriter example demonstrating DSPy's prompt optimization capabilities
